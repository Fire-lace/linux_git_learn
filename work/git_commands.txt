Git commands
1) Git add: Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area.
2) Git branch: This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool
3) Git checkout: In addition to checking out old commits and old file revisions, git
	checkout is also the means to navigate existing branches.
4) Git clean: Removes untracked files from the working directory.
5) Git clone: Creates a copy of an existing Git repository.
6) Git commit: Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. 
7) Git commit --amend: Passing the --amend flag to git commit lets you amend
	the most recent commit. 
8) Git config: A convenient way to set configuration options for your Git installation.
9) Git init: Initializes a new Git repository.
10)Git pull: It downloads a branch from a remote repository, 
	then immediately merges it into the current branch. 
	This is the Git equivalent of svn update.
 11) Git push: Pushing is the opposite of fetching (with a few caveats). It lets you move a local branch to another repository, which serves as a convenient way to publish contributions.
